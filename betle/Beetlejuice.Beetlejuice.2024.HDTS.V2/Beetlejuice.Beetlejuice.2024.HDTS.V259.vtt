dad's six packs and go hide
out in the tree fort and one day...

59:12.249 --> 59:13.999
I slipped and fell.

59:15.708 --> 59:16.708
How long ago did that happen?

59:17.083 --> 59:20.708
Twenty-three years, five months and
fourteen days. But who's counting? I've been

59:20.708 --> 59:24.083
stuck in this house for twenty-three
years. I can't go any further than that tree.

59:25.208 --> 59:27.458
I've just spent my
time watching the world go

59:27.458 --> 59:31.333
by, but then you came
along and you could see me.

59:33.208 --> 59:35.583
And I've been on my
own for so long, it was like a

59:35.583 --> 59:39.583
grenade had gone off in my
head. It was amazing. You're amazing.

59:40.499 --> 59:41.208
I should go.

59:41.208 --> 59:48.208
I know, I know, it's insane. But I
really like you and I want us to be together.

59:49.583 --> 59:53.208
How? You're dead. I'm
alive. That doesn't make any sense.

59:54.583 --> 01:00:02.208
Well, what if I told you that I'd
found a way to come back to be human again?
