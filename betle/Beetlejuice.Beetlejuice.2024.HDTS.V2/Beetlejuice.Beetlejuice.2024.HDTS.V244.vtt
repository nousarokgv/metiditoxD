44:08.833 --> 44:09.708
Oh, my God, it's you.

44:10.083 --> 44:11.624
I thought a moose was about to attack me.

44:12.249 --> 44:13.833
It's breathing exercises.

44:14.749 --> 44:16.124
Try seeing ghosts every day.

44:18.083 --> 44:18.583
Astrid!

44:20.374 --> 44:20.874
Let her be.

44:21.583 --> 44:22.624
She hates me.

44:23.208 --> 44:24.249
[ Laughs ]

44:24.624 --> 44:26.999
Somehow, Richard's
death is still my fault.

44:27.333 --> 44:28.833
You blame me for your mother's.

44:29.333 --> 44:30.249
She's not dead.

44:30.958 --> 44:32.458
And I didn't blame you.

44:32.708 --> 44:33.583
I resented you.

44:33.958 --> 44:34.708
There's a difference.

44:35.083 --> 44:35.958
You weren't very nice.

44:36.624 --> 44:38.708
No, you barely acknowledge my existence.

44:39.333 --> 44:40.749
But we've done all right, haven't we?

44:41.083 --> 44:41.333
Yeah.

44:41.708 --> 44:45.124
Ever since I sold out and
got famous, we have gotten closer.

44:45.458 --> 44:47.208
No, I started liking you before that.

44:49.083 --> 44:49.583
Whoo!

44:50.583 --> 44:50.749
Whoo!

44:51.583 --> 44:51.958
Whoo!

44:52.458 --> 44:53.583
Again with the creepy breathing!

44:53.999 --> 44:54.458
It works.

44:54.874 --> 44:57.458
I learned it at the
survivor's retreat where I met Rory.

44:57.708 --> 44:58.249
Of course you did.

44:58.499 --> 45:01.083
I was in shock after Richard died,

45:01.083 --> 45:02.958
and I was working
on my unresolved feelings,
