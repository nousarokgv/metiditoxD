08:08.916 --> 08:11.874
Tell us about the
inspiration for the human canvas.

08:12.249 --> 08:13.624
I am my own canvas.

08:14.249 --> 08:15.499
I am my art.

08:16.041 --> 08:18.374
As we know, art imitates the living.

08:19.291 --> 08:20.124
It feeds me.

08:21.124 --> 08:24.541
And I was not getting enough
nourishment from the sculpture alone.

08:25.374 --> 08:29.749
So I decided to broaden
my tastes, and it turns out I am.

08:30.374 --> 08:32.374
Delia, where have you been?

08:32.749 --> 08:34.874
I think I've cried
all the water out of my body.

08:34.874 --> 08:35.874
What happened to Dad?

08:36.374 --> 08:37.374
I just laid a table.

08:38.874 --> 08:40.916
He is the Picasso graffiti artist.

08:41.166 --> 08:43.249
He was tagging me like
the walls of the Paris Metro.

08:43.249 --> 08:45.291
But now he's having a petite tantrum.

08:45.874 --> 08:47.041
Because I had to cancel the performance.

08:47.833 --> 08:48.416
What happened?

08:49.291 --> 08:50.749
What? Oh.

08:53.291 --> 08:54.124
Your father's left me.

08:54.999 --> 08:56.166
He's divorcing you?

08:56.624 --> 08:57.833
What a horrible thought.

08:58.499 --> 09:00.041
No, he's dead.

09:01.166 --> 09:01.458
What?
