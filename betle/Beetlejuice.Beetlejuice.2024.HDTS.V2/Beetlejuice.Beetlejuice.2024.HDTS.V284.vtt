01:24:03.499 --> 01:24:04.291
Your Beatles is loaded.

01:24:04.749 --> 01:24:05.124
Ha-ha.

01:24:06.041 --> 01:24:08.624
Part of the deal is you
can never, ever say my name.

01:24:08.624 --> 01:24:08.749
Ever.

01:24:09.374 --> 01:24:09.749
What deal?

01:24:09.999 --> 01:24:11.499
The deal she made to save you.

01:24:11.749 --> 01:24:12.999
By the way, you can call me dad.

01:24:13.374 --> 01:24:15.416
Lydia, you agreed to marry him?

01:24:16.541 --> 01:24:19.249
I was desperate,
and it was my only option.

01:24:19.916 --> 01:24:21.416
Lydia, what's going on here?

01:24:22.624 --> 01:24:22.916
Wow.

01:24:24.749 --> 01:24:25.124
Awkward.

01:24:26.499 --> 01:24:27.291
You haven't made much
progress since our last session,

01:24:27.374 --> 01:24:30.291
so I'm going to
suggest some drug therapy.

01:24:31.249 --> 01:24:32.166
Don't be afraid to share.

01:24:32.499 --> 01:24:32.999
When you're ready.

01:24:35.666 --> 01:24:35.749
[GROANING]

01:24:35.749 --> 01:24:37.624
[PANTING]

01:24:39.916 --> 01:24:41.749
I always thought
your whole act was bullshit.

01:24:41.749 --> 01:24:44.291
I never believed in
ghosts, spirits, or any of it.

01:24:44.499 --> 01:24:46.249
What? All this time?

01:24:46.749 --> 01:24:48.041
Why the hell do you want to get married?

01:24:48.999 --> 01:24:49.499
Money!

01:24:50.124 --> 01:24:52.499
I knew I could make more as your
husband than I could as your manager.

01:24:53.166 --> 01:24:55.291
And I never had a dead fiancÃ©.

01:24:56.374 --> 01:24:58.124
I just went to that survivor's retreat so

01:24:58.124 --> 01:25:00.624
that I could meet
weak women and exploit them.

01:25:00.999 --> 01:25:02.999
And I hit the
codependent lottery when I met you.
