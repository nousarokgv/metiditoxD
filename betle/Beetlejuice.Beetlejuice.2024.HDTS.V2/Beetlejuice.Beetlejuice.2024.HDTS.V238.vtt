38:02.624 --> 38:03.749
Witness confirmed our suspect

38:03.749 --> 38:05.541
as the Soul Sucker from lost and found.

38:06.416 --> 38:07.541
Wanna hear the weird part, Chief?

38:07.666 --> 38:08.124
Hit me.

38:08.624 --> 38:11.249
After she turned the
owner into a human pancake,

38:12.249 --> 38:13.749
she stole her
wedding dress from the conveyor.

38:13.749 --> 38:17.291
Of course, this
stapled sicko has her twisted heart

38:17.624 --> 38:20.874
set on a romantic reunion with Mr. Juice.

38:21.374 --> 38:24.499
She won't stop
killing until she walks him back

38:24.874 --> 38:25.624
down the aisle.

38:28.249 --> 38:31.874
Cases like this make me
wonder why I even became a cop.

38:34.874 --> 38:36.749
You're not a cop, you're an actor.

38:37.749 --> 38:38.374
Thank you, Janet.

38:39.874 --> 38:40.666
You keep me real.

38:41.124 --> 38:43.249
Should we take this
Beetlejuice into protective custody?

38:43.624 --> 38:44.499
If you can find him.

38:44.999 --> 38:46.291
He's probably lying low.

38:47.124 --> 38:48.374
Scared out of his mind.

38:54.416 --> 38:55.583
Little higher, boys.

38:56.666 --> 38:58.416
Can't let Dolores get through that door.
