Rory saw him too,
but he thinks it's a dream.

55:10.333 --> 55:11.333
Wait, we can't leave yet.

55:13.249 --> 55:16.083
I have plans
tomorrow with this boy that I met.

55:17.999 --> 55:19.958
How did you have time to meet a boy?

55:20.499 --> 55:21.374
You had time to get married.

55:22.333 --> 55:23.833
She doesn't mean it. It's just karma.

55:24.833 --> 55:27.749
Whatever. I was biking, and
then I kind of crashed into his fence

55:27.749 --> 55:30.249
and we started talking, and then he
invited me over to his place for Halloween.

55:30.249 --> 55:33.583
Can I go, Mom?

55:35.874 --> 55:36.124
Please?

55:40.249 --> 55:44.333
I will not allow that menace to
humanity to up-heme our family again.

55:44.833 --> 55:47.124
No one goes in
there. No one calls his name.

55:47.999 --> 55:48.874
We're going to be fine, right?

55:49.958 --> 55:51.249
Mom, come on. We're going to be late.
