01:19:02.124 --> 01:19:02.374
Yes.

01:19:02.999 --> 01:19:03.916
I'm shedding my pants.

01:19:04.624 --> 01:19:06.249
What are you doing here?

01:19:06.541 --> 01:19:09.166
I'm searching for the last
names to bring back into the light.

01:19:09.666 --> 01:19:11.291
Why don't I give it right to the church?

01:19:11.374 --> 01:19:17.499
[NOISE]

01:19:21.791 --> 01:19:21.916
Sorry.

01:19:22.749 --> 01:19:24.124
I'll come right back.

01:19:24.791 --> 01:19:25.249
Excuse me.

01:19:26.499 --> 01:19:27.291
I'm sorry.

01:19:27.499 --> 01:19:28.916
I'm just late for a wedding.

01:19:29.749 --> 01:19:30.041
Yes.

01:19:30.499 --> 01:19:30.999
One question.

01:19:31.291 --> 01:19:32.291
How do I get out of here?

01:19:32.291 --> 01:19:33.791
Because someone made a terrible mistake.

01:19:33.791 --> 01:19:34.416
I'm on a break.

01:19:34.666 --> 01:19:35.249
Take a number.

01:19:35.416 --> 01:19:35.999
Take a seat.

01:19:35.999 --> 01:19:37.041
No, you see those asks.

01:19:37.249 --> 01:19:37.999
They were defanged.

01:19:37.999 --> 01:19:39.374
I paid extra for that.

01:19:39.374 --> 01:19:40.291
Honey, you're dead okay.

01:19:40.374 --> 01:19:43.374
Now take a number and sit down.

01:19:46.624 --> 01:19:50.166
Is there perhaps anyone
here who has the power to help me?

01:19:51.124 --> 01:19:52.749
Did that line used to work for you?

01:19:52.749 --> 01:19:54.291
I'm not dead.

01:19:55.499 --> 01:19:55.874
[LAUGHTER]

01:19:55.874 --> 01:19:56.874
Well, you know what?

01:19:57.166 --> 01:19:57.999
My husband's here.

01:19:58.291 --> 01:19:59.041
Charles Deets.

01:19:59.249 --> 01:20:00.374
Yes, he can fix us.

01:20:00.374 --> 01:20:02.041
You call him, he can
fix us, he can fix anything.

01:20:02.041 --> 01:20:03.499
Not anymore, he can't.
