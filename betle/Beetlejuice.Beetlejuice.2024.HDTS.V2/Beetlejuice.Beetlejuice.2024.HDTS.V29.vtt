09:02.374 --> 09:03.291
Daddy's passed away.

09:06.791 --> 09:07.291
How?

09:08.249 --> 09:13.708
He was returning from his
bird-watching expedition to the Funafuti Atoll.

09:15.791 --> 09:18.333
When his plane went
down in the South Pacific.

09:23.624 --> 09:24.666
A plane crash?

09:28.249 --> 09:29.833
This is the worst nightmare.

09:32.249 --> 09:33.749
Actually, he survived the crash.

09:33.749 --> 09:34.499
He drowned?

09:34.874 --> 09:35.541
Almost,

09:35.916 --> 09:36.291
but not quite.

09:36.624 --> 09:38.041
No, according to survivors.

09:38.416 --> 09:39.499
Daddy clung onto a wheel.

09:41.249 --> 09:41.833
Come over here!

09:42.166 --> 09:42.833
Come on!

09:42.958 --> 09:43.749
Swim over!

09:43.874 --> 09:44.499
Swim over!

09:45.083 --> 09:45.541
Hey!

09:46.958 --> 09:48.249
So how did he die?

09:48.624 --> 09:51.249
A shark jumped out
of the water and got him.

09:52.499 --> 09:53.374
Just like that.

09:55.249 --> 09:57.166
I just spoke to him on Saturday.

09:57.499 --> 09:58.416
He was so excited.

09:58.666 --> 10:00.874
He thanked me for the binoculars.

10:00.874 --> 10:03.291
He said he had
observed the mating rituals.
