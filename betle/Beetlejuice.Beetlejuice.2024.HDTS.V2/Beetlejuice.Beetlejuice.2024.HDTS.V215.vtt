15:08.458 --> 15:09.124
Perfect.

15:14.541 --> 15:15.708
Leave me alone.

15:28.249 --> 15:30.416
So it's settled, we'll
bring Charles home to Winter River.

15:31.124 --> 15:32.499
I've never hosted a funeral.

15:32.499 --> 15:35.208
I've never hosted anything
without Charles standing there,

15:35.749 --> 15:37.499
watching me in awe.

15:37.499 --> 15:39.124
It's Astrid,
please don't leave a message.

15:39.124 --> 15:40.749
She wont pick up.

15:40.999 --> 15:42.708
Maybe I should tell Astrid about Charles.

15:43.666 --> 15:46.624
Might be easier coming from
a non-feminine masculine archetype.

15:46.624 --> 15:48.499
Well, there aren't
any men left in the family.

15:49.499 --> 15:50.999
No offense taken, Delia.

15:51.624 --> 15:53.249
I'll be a member
of the family soon enough.

15:54.749 --> 15:57.541
In fact, I might be
the perfect person to tell her,

15:57.999 --> 15:59.791
having just lost my own grandfather.
