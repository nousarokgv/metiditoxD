50:01.874 --> 50:03.833
He said that I was
holding something back,

50:04.249 --> 50:06.124
and I faced it,
you and I wouldn't evolve.

50:06.458 --> 50:06.999
Mm-hmm.

50:07.333 --> 50:08.124
Oh, he was right.

50:08.749 --> 50:10.749
And I'm going to tell you now,

50:11.083 --> 50:13.874
in fair warning, it's
gonna sound batshit crazy.

50:15.124 --> 50:16.249
Are you okay with that?

50:17.333 --> 50:18.458
Of course. I'd love to.

50:18.458 --> 50:19.874
Let's break
through this barrier together.

50:20.708 --> 50:22.208
Oh, just give me a sec.

50:25.333 --> 50:27.333
When I was a teenager,

50:27.833 --> 50:31.083
a trickster demon
terrorized my entire family

50:31.249 --> 50:32.583
and tried to force me to marry him

50:32.583 --> 50:35.499
in order to come back
to the real world for good.

50:36.333 --> 50:38.083
I believed he was gone forever,

50:38.249 --> 50:40.999
and then lately I
have been seeing him again,

50:41.249 --> 50:43.208
and now he is actually back,

50:43.583 --> 50:46.874
and I don't know
why or how or what to do.

50:49.249 --> 50:49.958
Okay.

50:50.208 --> 50:51.749
So you're saying that
someone called Beatle is--

50:51.749 --> 50:53.208
Don't say his name.

50:53.208 --> 50:56.083
If you say his name
three times, he will appear.

50:58.458 --> 50:58.708
Okay.

50:59.249 --> 51:05.083
So this demon has clearly a
construct of your unpacked trauma.
