01:12:02.999 --> 01:12:03.249
Go figure.

01:12:03.666 --> 01:12:04.416
What just happened?

01:12:04.416 --> 01:12:05.166
Well, it's real simple.

01:12:05.166 --> 01:12:07.874
You remember the
chant that I got you to recite?

01:12:08.874 --> 01:12:13.124
You agreed to swap your life for mine.

01:12:14.166 --> 01:12:14.416
What?

01:12:14.874 --> 01:12:17.416
I needed your life so
that I could walk free again.

01:12:18.999 --> 01:12:22.791
She's got a seat on the soul
train, one way to the great beyond.

01:12:23.624 --> 01:12:24.166
You hustle.

01:12:24.374 --> 01:12:25.624
You can make the 835.

01:12:25.999 --> 01:12:26.874
Thank you very much.

01:12:26.874 --> 01:12:27.041
Wait.

01:12:27.374 --> 01:12:29.374
I never agreed to this.

01:12:29.541 --> 01:12:31.999
How do I cross back over?

01:12:32.499 --> 01:12:34.749
Get this stamped first, window 11.

01:12:35.124 --> 01:12:37.666
The transfer isn't permanent till then.

01:12:37.791 --> 01:12:38.374
There's nothing coming.

01:12:38.916 --> 01:12:42.374
There's nothing coming.

01:12:42.499 --> 01:12:42.999
Dad?

01:12:44.124 --> 01:12:44.624
A pastry.

01:12:44.874 --> 01:12:45.124
Dad?

01:12:45.666 --> 01:12:45.999
Dad!

01:12:46.874 --> 01:12:47.249
Help me!
