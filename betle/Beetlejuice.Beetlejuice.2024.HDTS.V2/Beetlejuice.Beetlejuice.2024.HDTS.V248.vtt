48:02.708 --> 48:05.249
Well, I think
that's... it's a little harsh.

48:06.874 --> 48:08.583
Uh, well, tomorrow's Halloween.

48:09.124 --> 48:09.458
I know.

48:10.208 --> 48:11.083
Used to be my favorite holiday.

48:12.333 --> 48:15.958
Because my dad, he would go all out
and make the most age-inappropriate costumes.

48:16.833 --> 48:20.249
Yeah, I think I was in second
grade when I went as Monks the Scream.

48:20.583 --> 48:20.833
Wow.

48:21.083 --> 48:21.333
Yeah.

48:21.708 --> 48:21.958
Yeah.

48:21.958 --> 48:22.374
It was a choice.

48:23.249 --> 48:25.458
But now my mom's getting
married that day, so I don't know.

48:25.458 --> 48:26.499
I'll probably be my least favorite now.

48:27.583 --> 48:28.374
What time is the wedding?

48:28.874 --> 48:29.208
The night.

48:30.208 --> 48:30.833
The witching hour.

48:31.333 --> 48:32.583
Future stepdad's lame idea.

48:34.374 --> 48:38.708
Well, why don't you come over earlier?

48:40.708 --> 48:42.874
Uh, we could... I don't know.

48:42.874 --> 48:46.083
We could order pizza and give out candy.

48:48.083 --> 48:49.208
Only if you want to.

48:49.458 --> 48:52.833
I mean, that's...
that's no... no pressure.

48:57.333 --> 48:58.624
What's up with these creepy birds?

49:00.208 --> 49:02.083
Birdwatching was my dad's passion.

49:02.333 --> 49:05.333
Oh, I contacted that
vintage shop you love in Soho.

49:06.374 --> 49:08.249
They've sent a few
potential wedding dresses.
