01:11:09.791 --> 01:11:09.999
What?

01:11:10.999 --> 01:11:11.249
No.

01:11:12.249 --> 01:11:13.166
No.

01:11:15.499 --> 01:11:15.624
No.

01:11:16.291 --> 01:11:16.499
No.

01:11:16.499 --> 01:11:17.541
Oh, no.

01:11:19.374 --> 01:11:19.749
Excuse me.

01:11:20.249 --> 01:11:22.249
What if a mistake's been made?

01:11:22.874 --> 01:11:24.624
Because I'm not supposed to be here.

01:11:31.499 --> 01:11:31.666
Seriously?

01:11:32.749 --> 01:11:34.999
I have global entry.

01:11:35.374 --> 01:11:36.624
Is there a line for that?

01:11:44.499 --> 01:11:44.749
Next.

01:11:45.874 --> 01:11:48.249
Stand on the marks and
look directly into the camera.

01:11:49.499 --> 01:11:50.749
Say, "Chee."

01:11:53.999 --> 01:11:54.249
Hello.

01:11:55.791 --> 01:11:56.374
Are you okay?

01:11:58.416 --> 01:11:58.666
Oh.

01:11:59.666 --> 01:12:00.624
I feel strange.

01:12:01.041 --> 01:12:01.874
I feel amazing.
