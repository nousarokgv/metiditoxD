36:04.124 --> 36:05.583
So how long have
you been in Wanchu River?

36:06.416 --> 36:07.083
My whole life.

36:07.874 --> 36:08.958
I've never seen you around before.

36:09.374 --> 36:11.083
Yeah, this is just a temporary layover

36:11.333 --> 36:12.374
for my grandpa's funeral.

36:13.833 --> 36:15.458
And so my mom's janky fiancee

36:15.458 --> 36:17.583
turned it into a
de facto engagement party.

36:17.999 --> 36:19.249
Yeah, he announced their wedding date.

36:20.374 --> 36:20.833
Wow.

36:21.416 --> 36:22.874
That's different.

36:23.541 --> 36:24.499
Oh yeah, if you knew my mom,

36:24.499 --> 36:25.749
that's actually pretty on brand for her.

36:27.083 --> 36:28.624
Is your dad in the picture?

36:32.958 --> 36:34.083
Yeah, he was a free spirit.

36:35.333 --> 36:36.416
Defender of hopeless causes.

36:36.999 --> 36:38.374
When they split, he went to Brazil.

36:39.416 --> 36:40.666
He was trying to save the rainforest.

36:42.541 --> 36:45.249
But my mom grew up
here, that old house on the hill.

36:46.624 --> 36:47.624
Wait, the ghost house?

36:48.708 --> 36:49.958
Is your mom Lydia Deetz?

36:51.333 --> 36:51.624
Unfortunately.

36:52.416 --> 36:53.374
She's a legend.

36:53.374 --> 36:55.583
Well yeah, if you
believe in supernatural bullshit.

36:56.999 --> 36:57.416
You don't?

36:59.333 --> 36:59.708
No.

37:01.041 --> 37:02.416
I only believe in
things that I could see.
