16:00.499 --> 16:01.916
You did? When?

16:02.708 --> 16:03.624
40 years ago.

16:04.333 --> 16:06.749
But in my child body, that's yesterday.

16:07.749 --> 16:08.916
I'm gonna tell Astrid, okay?

16:08.916 --> 16:10.749
Just give me a few
minutes before you come up.

16:10.749 --> 16:12.208
And now, I'll handle this.

16:15.083 --> 16:15.583
Astrid!

16:18.124 --> 16:18.874
Astrid!

16:20.124 --> 16:21.166
Astrid!

16:22.124 --> 16:24.291
Stop torturing your mother.

16:24.916 --> 16:27.624
I know I usually
find it funny and only fair

16:27.624 --> 16:29.541
after the way she
treated me when she was your age.

16:30.124 --> 16:31.249
But not today.

16:32.541 --> 16:34.541
Your mommy's lost her daddy.

16:35.624 --> 16:36.874
You've lost your grandpa.

16:37.916 --> 16:41.291
And I've lost my horny handyman.

16:42.749 --> 16:43.333
Charles.

16:44.416 --> 16:45.874
Charles!

16:46.666 --> 16:49.124
Oh, Charles!

16:52.333 --> 16:53.916
I can't believe grandpa's dead.

16:55.166 --> 16:57.124
He was like the only
semi-normal person in this family.

16:57.124 --> 16:59.708
We're gonna be in
Winter River for a few weeks.

16:59.708 --> 17:00.708
What do you mean for a few weeks?

17:00.708 --> 17:01.958
I thought we were
just going to the funeral.
