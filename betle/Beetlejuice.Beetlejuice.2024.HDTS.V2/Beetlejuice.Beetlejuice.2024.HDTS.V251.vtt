51:05.083 --> 51:06.499
It's trauma that
you're gonna need to face.

51:06.499 --> 51:07.583
Otherwise, it's just gonna get worse.

51:07.833 --> 51:11.083
He's not a
construct. He is literally a demon.

51:12.624 --> 51:14.333
I know this is a big step for you,

51:15.083 --> 51:16.458
but in the words of Dr. Glickman,

51:16.958 --> 51:18.499
I'm gonna give you the push you need.

51:21.208 --> 51:22.333
Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice.

51:30.249 --> 51:31.208
What just happened?

51:32.208 --> 51:33.208
We're in the model.

51:34.208 --> 51:35.083
That's not possible.

51:39.249 --> 51:40.708
What the hell?

51:40.999 --> 51:42.749
I told you not to say his name.

51:46.249 --> 51:48.208
Any of these, ladies and gentlemen.

51:48.749 --> 51:51.458
Don't ever say that name. Not ever.

51:51.958 --> 51:52.958
He needs to be his now.

51:53.333 --> 51:55.374
Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice.

51:55.708 --> 51:58.624
Is that--

51:59.249 --> 51:59.374
Beetlejuice.
