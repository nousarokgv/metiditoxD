I told him he needed to wear contacts.

06:11.374 --> 06:11.791
But no.

06:12.624 --> 06:14.874
Mr. Big Shot Magician wouldn't listen.

06:14.874 --> 06:16.624
Can you give it a rest, Nadia?

06:16.624 --> 06:18.374
I'm having a really shitty day.

06:22.791 --> 06:23.666
What happened out there?

06:25.874 --> 06:26.374
You okay?

06:27.541 --> 06:28.999
Yeah, I'm fine.

06:29.749 --> 06:32.374
These double
taping days, it can get to me.

06:33.749 --> 06:35.249
It kills me to see you feeling like this.

06:36.166 --> 06:37.291
Because when you're feeling like this,

06:37.291 --> 06:39.249
it just makes me feel like
you're feeling so in a weird way.

06:39.249 --> 06:41.624
It's like when
you're hurting, it's hurting me.

06:41.874 --> 06:42.249
I don't know.

06:42.624 --> 06:45.874
I'm sorry. I don't
mean to make you feel like that.

06:45.999 --> 06:46.666
It's okay.

06:48.291 --> 06:49.999
I think it just
shows how connected we are.

06:52.499 --> 06:54.249
It's like we got the
same stupid little heart.

07:04.249 --> 07:06.833
No. You don't need these.
