01:07:08.374 --> 01:07:10.124
The juice is loose.

01:07:12.749 --> 01:07:15.124
I need you to tell me what this means.

01:07:15.124 --> 01:07:16.541
Oh, man. Let's have a look, shall we.

01:07:17.124 --> 01:07:19.499
Long story short,
your daughter's screwed.

01:07:19.749 --> 01:07:21.416
She decided to trade lives with a boy.

01:07:21.624 --> 01:07:24.124
He gets to come back while
She's stuck on the other side permanently.

01:07:24.749 --> 01:07:26.541
One way ticket on the soul train.

01:07:26.874 --> 01:07:27.499
Soul train.

01:07:27.499 --> 01:07:29.999
That's right. Last
stop. The great beyond.

01:07:29.999 --> 01:07:34.166
She can't get on that train. You've
got to get me in there so I can get her out.

01:07:34.166 --> 01:07:36.874
Well, I can get you in,
but I'd say you could pro quo.

01:07:37.374 --> 01:07:38.874
Of course there is. What do you want?

01:07:39.666 --> 01:07:42.624
Well, I've got this ex-wife,
you know, and she's kind of whack-job,

01:07:42.624 --> 01:07:44.999
first of all, or
through. She's kind of clingy.

01:07:45.249 --> 01:07:46.874
So I could just get
away from her permanently.

01:07:46.874 --> 01:07:47.499
You want me to marry you?

01:07:48.124 --> 01:07:48.999
Thought youâ€™d never ask.

01:07:49.374 --> 01:07:51.041
How do I know that
you're going to keep your word?

01:07:51.749 --> 01:07:53.124
I swear on my dead mother's...

01:07:53.124 --> 01:07:53.374
Yeah.

01:07:54.041 --> 01:07:54.499
Nice.

01:07:56.999 --> 01:07:59.916
Okay, fine. I'll marry you
if you help me save my daughter.

01:08:00.374 --> 01:08:01.249
I'm going to need that in writing.
