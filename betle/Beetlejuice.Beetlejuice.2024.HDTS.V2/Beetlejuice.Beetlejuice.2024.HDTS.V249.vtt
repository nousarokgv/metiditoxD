49:08.333 --> 49:09.708
Should be here later today.

49:10.458 --> 49:11.583
Great. Thanks.

49:13.499 --> 49:18.374
One day, uh, little bird may have
chipped our big news to a few news outlets.

49:18.708 --> 49:19.208
Oh.

49:19.458 --> 49:21.124
Oh, we could sell the photos exclusively.

49:21.833 --> 49:22.999
Could be great press for the show.

49:24.083 --> 49:26.249
Look, I'm really
excited about tying the knot.

49:26.458 --> 49:28.708
But can we just
keep it small and private?

49:29.708 --> 49:29.958
Yeah.

49:30.749 --> 49:31.374
Oh, sure.

49:32.333 --> 49:33.124
It's your big day.

49:33.833 --> 49:34.624
Night, whatever.

49:35.249 --> 49:35.624
Uh-oh.

49:37.249 --> 49:40.999
Yo, I got lemons for
an old... old ruby flower.

49:43.374 --> 49:45.374
Lydia?

49:48.624 --> 49:50.333
I want you out of my life.

49:51.124 --> 49:51.958
Did you hear me?

49:52.958 --> 49:53.208
Lydia?

49:55.333 --> 49:56.583
Who are you yelling at?

49:58.124 --> 49:59.958
Do you remember that couple's stare?

49:59.958 --> 50:01.458
I thought we saw Dr. Glickman.
