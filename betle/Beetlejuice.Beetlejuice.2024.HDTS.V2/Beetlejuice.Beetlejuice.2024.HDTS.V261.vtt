01:01:04.583 --> 01:01:08.958
You gotta run. See you at the church?
Oh, unless you're calling off the wedding.

01:01:09.708 --> 01:01:12.208
No, Delia. Where are you going?

01:01:12.624 --> 01:01:12.999
Cemetery.

01:01:14.124 --> 01:01:16.208
To commune with my dear husband's spirit.

01:01:18.374 --> 01:01:23.708
I need a skitaddle, too. I'm
co-chaperoning Lillar James Girl Scout Troop.

01:01:24.583 --> 01:01:28.583
We spent weeks coming up with a
group costume scene. We agreed nothing Disney.

01:01:29.583 --> 01:01:34.083
The closest we ever got to Disney was
when Astrid dressed a Cinderella's dead mom.

01:01:35.624 --> 01:01:37.374
You'll never guess
what the girls came up with.

01:01:37.958 --> 01:01:43.249
Fruit salad. Isn't that
genius? It's healthy and non-triggering.

01:01:44.333 --> 01:01:45.208
I'm going as...

01:01:47.874 --> 01:01:51.249
reverse mortgage. Which
is mortgage spelled backwards.

01:01:53.083 --> 01:01:53.708
Where is Astrid?

01:01:54.458 --> 01:01:57.874
On a date. Her first. I'm more nervous

01:01:57.874 --> 01:02:00.708
than she is. The
boy lives over on Jefferson.
