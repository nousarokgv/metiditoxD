01:00:03.208 --> 01:00:07.333
It's all in this book. Everyone
gets one of these when they die. It's kind of

01:00:07.333 --> 01:00:12.499
complicated, but I can only do
it with the help of a living person.

01:00:14.208 --> 01:00:16.624
And you could
literally give me my life back.

01:00:17.208 --> 01:00:19.708
I don't know. Maybe we could ask my mom,

01:00:19.999 --> 01:00:21.833
because she's supposed
to be the undead expert, right?

01:00:22.583 --> 01:00:26.708
I'm sure she'll
give you a million reasons to

01:00:26.708 --> 01:00:29.499
stay away, but I'll
give you one reason to help me.

01:00:31.583 --> 01:00:34.958
You get to see your dad again.

01:00:35.583 --> 01:00:52.583
I have the first
official open house a week from

01:00:52.583 --> 01:00:54.958
Sunday, and then we
will let the bidding war begin.

01:00:55.583 --> 01:00:56.208
Where's Rory?

01:00:56.749 --> 01:01:00.083
Supermarket, swapping
out the candy I bought for carrot

01:01:00.083 --> 01:01:03.333
sticks. Because Rory loves to
fun suck everything. Even Halloween.
