It's long, I didn't
memorize it or anything like that.

30:04.583 --> 30:05.749
It's quite beautiful.

30:05.958 --> 30:06.999
Cut the crap, Rory.

30:07.833 --> 30:09.874
All right, I'm not
falling for your new age,

30:09.874 --> 30:11.791
overly emotional, trauma bonding,

30:11.791 --> 30:12.916
yoga retreat bullshit.

30:14.208 --> 30:16.749
I see you, because like you,

30:16.999 --> 30:19.624
my mom is a very broken person.

30:20.124 --> 30:21.833
Okay, she's a delusional fantasist.

30:23.083 --> 30:25.208
You just exploit her and if
she wants to allow that to happen,

30:25.416 --> 30:26.166
that's on her.

30:37.458 --> 30:38.958
Thank you.

30:40.833 --> 30:43.166
Oh, if it isn't little Jane Butterfield.

30:43.791 --> 30:44.624
Littler Jane?

30:45.583 --> 30:47.916
Oh, it's Jane
Butterfield Lee now, we hyphenated.

30:48.541 --> 30:49.416
Is that Becky Dean?

30:50.124 --> 30:50.374
No.

30:50.541 --> 30:50.916
No.

30:51.624 --> 30:52.749
No one's here yet.

30:55.374 --> 30:57.166
Sample from my hubby's microbrewery.

30:57.458 --> 30:59.666
Micro, is that for
people with tiny houses?

31:00.624 --> 31:03.333
Why is your house
covered in black fabric?
