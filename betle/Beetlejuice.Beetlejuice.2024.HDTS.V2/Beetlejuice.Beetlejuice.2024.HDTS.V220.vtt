20:05.958 --> 20:06.749
Come on.

20:07.124 --> 20:08.166
Yeah, easy with the suit.

20:10.833 --> 20:11.874
You know the protester?

20:13.374 --> 20:17.749
Wolf Jackson, afterlife, crime units.

20:18.874 --> 20:20.166
Let me take a wild stab.

20:20.999 --> 20:21.458
Actor.

20:21.999 --> 20:23.458
Not just any actor.

20:24.291 --> 20:26.958
I've done it all
for six movies and a reboot.

20:27.666 --> 20:29.749
I became Frank Hardballer.

20:30.166 --> 20:32.333
Doing my own stunts was non-negotiable.

20:32.624 --> 20:33.291
You know why?

20:33.291 --> 20:34.249
Authenticity.

20:34.249 --> 20:35.291
Correct.

20:35.291 --> 20:37.624
A vice cop doesn't get to a perp store

20:37.624 --> 20:41.291
and then call for some
ham-boned stuntman to break it down.

20:41.291 --> 20:42.458
Neither did I.

20:43.374 --> 20:44.333
You got to keep it real.

20:44.624 --> 20:46.874
Looks like you got a
little too real there, bud.

20:48.958 --> 20:50.333
Who knew it was a live grenade?

20:50.916 --> 20:54.374
Your name came up on
this case I'm investigating.

20:59.374 --> 21:00.749
Recognize this, puss.
