45:03.208 --> 45:06.208
and Rory had just lost
his fiancÃ© in a skiing accident.

45:06.208 --> 45:09.874
We were in the same
sorrow circle, and we connected.

45:10.458 --> 45:10.749
Yeah.

45:11.374 --> 45:13.833
He was turned on by you
at the lowest point in your life.

45:14.333 --> 45:15.708
But this isn't about him.

45:16.333 --> 45:17.249
Astrid found this in the attic.

45:17.333 --> 45:18.374
Ew.

45:19.208 --> 45:19.458
So?

45:20.833 --> 45:21.083
So.

45:21.958 --> 45:24.333
Every now and then, I feel his presence.

45:24.333 --> 45:26.874
Like he's lurking
somewhere, just out of reach.

45:27.333 --> 45:29.874
But neatly, I'm seeing him again.

45:30.458 --> 45:33.374
And I was really hoping this
was all in my head, but now this?

45:33.833 --> 45:35.958
Lydia, you need to take back your life.

45:36.249 --> 45:38.208
From the hangar honors, from this thing.

45:39.208 --> 45:42.499
Where is the obnoxious little goth
girl who tormented me all those years ago?

45:43.624 --> 45:44.249
It's time to find her.

45:47.249 --> 45:56.958
[dog barking]

45:59.249 --> 45:59.833
Hey.

46:00.208 --> 46:00.333
Hey.

46:01.624 --> 46:05.333
[dog barking]
