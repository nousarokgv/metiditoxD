Snakes.

54:12.874 --> 54:15.333
Actually, it asks,
"Weren't they beautiful?"

54:16.208 --> 54:16.999
Wedding gift for Rory?

54:18.583 --> 54:19.999
Too late. They've been defanged.

54:20.708 --> 54:22.583
Guaranteed harmless. And they're for me.

54:23.458 --> 54:27.249
In ancient Egypt, a queen would
perform a ceremony at the tomb of her pharaoh

54:27.249 --> 54:29.958
using snakes, a symbol of undying love.

54:30.374 --> 54:31.083
And you sure about that?

54:31.708 --> 54:34.124
We read that they were a
constant threat to raw in the underworld

54:34.124 --> 54:35.458
and represented total chaos.

54:35.708 --> 54:38.249
Okay, see, that's why
schools need more art and less reading.

54:38.333 --> 54:41.583
You got your wish. We're
leaving. School, pack up your things.

54:41.583 --> 54:42.583
I'm driving you back to school.

54:42.874 --> 54:43.458
Wait, what happened?

54:44.083 --> 54:45.708
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

54:46.374 --> 54:50.458
I will pay for a fleet of
movers to take everything back to Manhattan

54:50.458 --> 54:53.708
except that model. We
need to chop it up and burn it.

54:54.999 --> 54:56.833
Oh, you're calling off the wedding?

54:58.124 --> 55:02.499
What did that cheese ball do now?

55:02.874 --> 55:03.833
It's not Rory.

55:05.499 --> 55:07.958
He's here in the model. I saw him.
