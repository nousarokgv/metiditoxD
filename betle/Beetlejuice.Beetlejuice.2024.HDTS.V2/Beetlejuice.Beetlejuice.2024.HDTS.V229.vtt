29:03.166 --> 29:04.166
I'm here for you.

29:07.791 --> 29:10.208
Emotions processed, thanks.

29:10.541 --> 29:12.791
I saw you standing
at your grandfather's grave.

29:14.791 --> 29:15.999
Must have been a pretty dope dude.

29:18.583 --> 29:20.166
Death is so like,

29:23.124 --> 29:24.624
that's like tragic, you know?

29:25.708 --> 29:28.958
If you ever wanna cry or just rage

29:28.958 --> 29:29.833
against some of these feelings

29:29.833 --> 29:31.333
that you have going on in there,

29:31.583 --> 29:34.291
I want you to know that I could be that

29:35.666 --> 29:38.583
kind of dope dad dude for you, you know?

29:41.124 --> 29:41.458
I'm good.

29:41.583 --> 29:43.249
You know, times like
this can bring a family

29:43.249 --> 29:44.458
weirdly closer
together.

29:45.416 --> 29:46.208
On the way over here

29:47.083 --> 29:48.374
I wrote a poem for your grandpa.

29:48.874 --> 29:49.458
Oh, did you?

29:50.333 --> 29:50.749
How does it go?

29:52.333 --> 29:55.958
It's, it's, it starts,

29:55.958 --> 29:59.249
it kind of like
opens on grief, obviously,

29:59.249 --> 30:00.291
and then acceptance.
