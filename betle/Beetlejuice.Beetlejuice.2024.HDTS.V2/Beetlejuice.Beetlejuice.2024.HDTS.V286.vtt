[GROANING]

01:26:05.249 --> 01:26:08.874
Spring was never waiting for us, girl.

01:26:09.624 --> 01:26:14.291
It ran one step ahead
as we followed in the dance.

01:26:14.374 --> 01:26:21.791
[GROANING]

01:26:22.541 --> 01:26:28.041
Between the parted pages
and we're pressed in rough subsea,

01:26:28.041 --> 01:26:31.749
but I'm like a striped pair of pants.

01:26:32.374 --> 01:26:38.999
[GROANING]

01:26:38.999 --> 01:26:42.249
The heart, the
spark is melting in the dark.

01:26:42.916 --> 01:26:46.374
All the sweet green icing's slowing down.

01:26:47.374 --> 01:26:50.416
Someone left the cake out in the rain.

01:26:51.416 --> 01:26:54.291
I don't think that I can take it,

01:26:54.374 --> 01:26:57.541
because it took so long to bake it,

01:26:57.541 --> 01:27:01.374
and I'll never have that recipe again.
