01:02:01.083 --> 01:02:03.833
Don't mention that
street. I have a listing

01:02:03.833 --> 01:02:05.708
that's kept me
from a perfect sales record.

01:02:06.458 --> 01:02:10.124
Oh, it's my own fault. The
place had been on the market for years.

01:02:10.708 --> 01:02:14.958
But I thought if I could sell a
murder house, it would be a feather in my cap.

01:02:14.958 --> 01:02:17.583
A murder house? Which house?

01:02:18.583 --> 01:02:19.083
125.

01:02:20.624 --> 01:02:23.833
That's where I dropped Astrid
off. She was seeing a boy named Jeremy.

01:02:25.333 --> 01:02:28.958
Jeremy Fraser. I
didn't get his last name.

01:02:30.208 --> 01:02:33.958
Oh, no, it can't be him.
But Jeremy Fraser was bad news.

01:02:35.208 --> 01:02:37.249
Twenty-three years ago, he murdered his

01:02:37.249 --> 01:02:40.708
parents. The cops found
him hiding in his tree house.

01:02:40.708 --> 01:02:44.583
When they tried to get him out,
he fell, broke his neck, died instantly.

01:02:50.958 --> 01:02:52.708
That's all you have to
do to get into the afterlife?

01:02:53.624 --> 01:02:56.708
Draw a door with some
chalk. Oh, a knock three times?

01:02:56.708 --> 01:02:58.124
I'm just doing what it says in there.

01:02:58.458 --> 01:03:00.124
So lame.
