33:02.791 --> 33:04.541
Well, there's the death of Charles,

33:04.541 --> 33:05.666
of course the death of my grandfather,

33:05.666 --> 33:10.124
which you know
about, and now the death of us.

33:10.124 --> 33:13.291
Oh, don't, come on, I didn't mean that.

33:13.291 --> 33:15.333
You wanted to take
life's great big bungee jump

33:15.333 --> 33:16.291
right beside me.

33:16.291 --> 33:17.708
No safety nets, right?

33:18.374 --> 33:22.333
I guess the only thing
bungee jumping today is love.

33:22.708 --> 33:23.916
And that cord just snapped.

33:24.458 --> 33:26.833
Oh, come on, Rory, I love you.

33:27.624 --> 33:28.499
I love you.

33:32.583 --> 33:33.666
What are we waiting for?

33:35.958 --> 33:37.249
Okay, I guess.

33:40.458 --> 33:41.708
Oh my God.

33:46.208 --> 33:47.041
She said yes.

33:48.958 --> 33:49.791
She said yes.

33:52.041 --> 33:52.541
Astrid!
