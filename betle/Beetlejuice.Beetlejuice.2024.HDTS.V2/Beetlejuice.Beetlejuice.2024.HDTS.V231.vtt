31:04.124 --> 31:05.166
It's a mourning shroud.

31:06.166 --> 31:08.499
Now that Charles is
dead, so also dies this house.

31:09.541 --> 31:11.458
And I'm protecting it in its transition.

31:11.874 --> 31:13.749
To a new life with a new family.

31:14.624 --> 31:15.958
I can't wait to show it.

31:15.958 --> 31:17.458
Buyers are already lining up.

31:17.833 --> 31:18.624
Thanks to you, Lydia.

31:18.958 --> 31:21.458
Everyone wants a piece
of the original ghost house.

31:21.791 --> 31:22.833
Ghosts aren't real.

31:23.208 --> 31:25.124
Only gullible people
believe that kind of crap.

31:25.749 --> 31:26.999
Unless youâ€™re trying to
pay the bills, right, Mom?

31:27.708 --> 31:28.916
Okay, honey, here we go.

31:30.749 --> 31:32.333
Can I have everyone's attention, please?

31:32.833 --> 31:33.208
What?

31:33.208 --> 31:35.916
We're gathered here
today to celebrate the life

31:36.583 --> 31:37.999
of an extraordinary man.

31:38.624 --> 31:40.374
Now, I only had the
pleasure of meeting Charles

31:40.374 --> 31:41.208
a few times.

31:41.208 --> 31:43.249
Then I can tell you
he didn't want any speeches.

31:43.791 --> 31:45.999
Charles hated public displays of emotion.

31:46.374 --> 31:51.208
Yeah, but he also chose
to live his life to the fullest.

31:51.458 --> 31:54.583
I am going to tear a
page out of Charles Deetz's book.

31:54.958 --> 31:57.833
Lydia, now I know we had always agreed

31:57.833 --> 31:59.083
to take our relationship slowly,

31:59.083 --> 32:00.666
but I can't wait any longer.
