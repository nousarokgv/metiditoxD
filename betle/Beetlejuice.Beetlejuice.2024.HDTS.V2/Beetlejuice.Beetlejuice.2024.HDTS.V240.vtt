40:00.749 --> 40:03.374
We cannot sincerely
celebrate all that was good

40:03.374 --> 40:04.791
about our dearly departed.

40:05.249 --> 40:08.374
Not until we released the
horror that they inflicted upon us.

40:08.624 --> 40:10.374
What awful thing
did Grandpa ever do to you?

40:10.999 --> 40:12.416
He bought this house without telling me.

40:16.624 --> 40:17.291
Oh my God.

40:18.791 --> 40:20.541
I was helpfully
getting some boxes in town

40:20.541 --> 40:21.666
and I heard you screaming.

40:21.666 --> 40:22.291
Are you all right?

40:22.374 --> 40:23.291
It was Delia.

40:24.749 --> 40:25.416
Oh, Delia.

40:25.874 --> 40:26.874
I'm good.

40:27.874 --> 40:28.624
Ignore her.

40:29.374 --> 40:30.874
I was very thoughtful of you.

40:30.874 --> 40:32.499
Ask her, can you give
him a hand with the boxes?

40:33.624 --> 40:36.124
I told the movers to
come a week from today, all right?

40:36.124 --> 40:37.999
I think that'll give us
all time to get over our grief

40:37.999 --> 40:39.874
and our trauma,
and then after the wedding,

40:39.874 --> 40:41.749
I think we should go back
and we gotta finish those shows.

40:42.541 --> 40:44.958
Maybe Mom can get the ghosts in
the attic to give use a hand.

40:45.374 --> 40:47.083
Adam and Barbara Maitland.

40:47.083 --> 40:48.166
They're not here anymore.

40:48.541 --> 40:50.041
Why, they found a better house to haunt?

40:50.291 --> 40:52.874
No, we found a
loophole and they moved on.

40:53.749 --> 40:55.624
How convenient.
