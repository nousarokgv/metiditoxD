17:01.958 --> 17:03.583
We need to clear out the house.

17:03.874 --> 17:05.041
Grandpa loved that place.

17:05.333 --> 17:09.041
Yes, and we are going to
honor him with a grief collective.

17:09.124 --> 17:09.916
A grief collective?

17:10.291 --> 17:15.916
I am seeing a
semi-multimedia visual manifesto of our loss.

17:16.583 --> 17:20.124
What does loss look like?
Is it just tears? A headstone?

17:20.374 --> 17:21.624
Wilting gladioli?

17:21.624 --> 17:25.499
No, we need to unpack the art of sorrow!

17:27.166 --> 17:28.749
Yeah, that sounds really dramatic.

17:29.374 --> 17:30.041
I can't go.

17:30.666 --> 17:32.749
I'm our school rep for our
student environmental conference next week.

17:33.416 --> 17:34.999
Presenting our
demands on climate change action.

17:35.166 --> 17:37.374
I spoke with the
principal and they cleared it.

17:37.833 --> 17:39.999
She actually thinks
it's a really good idea.

17:40.291 --> 17:42.291
Well, I guess when you
donate an entire art center,

17:42.291 --> 17:44.124
the principal becomes
your little puppet on a string.

17:45.458 --> 17:47.291
Well, you're free
to reject your inheritance

17:47.291 --> 17:49.749
when you're living
high off a tree hugger's salary.

17:53.541 --> 17:53.916
What?

17:54.333 --> 17:55.249
No, no.

17:58.333 --> 18:00.749
Jesus, people already
know that Lydia Deetz is my mom.
